Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Public and private subnets allow all traffic on all ports. Specific and targeted Network ACL rules should be applied to reduce the traffic that can be sent to and from the subnet, that is, CIDR blocks and ports. By doing so we reduce the options for malicious attacks against the infrastructure.

# Poor practice 2
No encryption on bucket content. The content is not client encrypted and there are no server side encryption on any of the buckets. Additionally there are nothing blocking public access to the VPC Flow Logs and the Free Recipe buckets. This could result in people being able to see and read content that they should not have seen. This is especially an issue for VPC Flog Logs that will contain information that would be useful for an attacker, additional security compromises.

# Poor practice 3
The use of VPC Endpoint for communicating with S3 should be prefered as it improves security and also increases availability because we would not be required to communicate with S3 over the internet.
