# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
- CloudSploit works on Cloudformation templates and perform over 95 checks across over 40 resource types
- CFRipper Library and CLI tool for analysing CloudFormation templates and check for security compliance.
- Terrafirma is a Terraform static analysis tool designed for detecting security misconfigurations.

### Example vulnerability
- Security groups set to "0.0.0.0/0"
- Server Side Encryption (SSE) not enabled
- KMS keys that don't have rotation enabled
- Access logs not enabled to resources that support it


##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
- AWS Inspector generates findings for the following AWS resources: Amazon EC2 instances, and container images residing in Amazon ECR repositories
- Amazon ECR image scanning helps in identifying software vulnerabilities in container images. Amazon ECR integrates with Amazon Inspector to provide automated, continuous scanning of your repositories
- Qualys Cloud Platform paints a single view of the application in terms of security and compliance

### Example vulnerability
- Package vulnerability findings identify software packages in your environment that are exposed to common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs).
- Network reachability findings indicate that there are allowed network paths to Amazon EC2 instances in your environment (EC2 only).


##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
- AWS Config: A service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations
- AWS Security Hub is a cloud security posture management service that performs automated, continuous security best practice checks against your AWS resources.

### Example vulnerability
- Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 
- Ensure CloudTrail logs are encrypted at rest
- Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
- EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
- S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
